## Monetization Model

Veiled-Verse implements a multi-tier monetization system:

- **Pay-Per-Story:** Writers set custom prices; revenue split between writers, platform, and reader rewards.
- **Subscription Tiers:** Free, Bronze, Silver, and Gold, each with increasing benefits and discounts.
- **Writer Earnings:** Calculated based on price, quality, engagement, word count, and bonuses.
- **Reader Rewards:** Earn points for reading, rating, commenting, sharing, and daily logins; points convert to credits.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Smart suggestions based on market data, author reputation, and demand.
