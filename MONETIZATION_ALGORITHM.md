  // Quality bonus based on ratings
  const ratingBonus =
    story.averageRating >= 4.5
      ? 0.15
      : story.averageRating >= 4.0
        ? 0.1
        : story.averageRating >= 3.5
          ? 0.05
          : 0;

  // Engagement bonus
  const engagementBonus = Math.min(
    story.likes * 0.01 + story.shares * 0.02 + story.comments * 0.005,
    0.2, // Max 20% engagement bonus
  );

  // Word count bonus
  const wordCountBonus =
    story.wordCount > 5000 ? 0.1 : story.wordCount > 2000 ? 0.05 : 0;

  // Time-based bonus (stories published within 30 days)
  const timeBonus = isRecentStory(story) ? 0.05 : 0;

  const totalEarnings =
    baseEarnings *
    (1 + ratingBonus + engagementBonus + wordCountBonus + timeBonus);

  return Math.round(totalEarnings * 100) / 100; // Round to 2 decimal places
};
```

```
